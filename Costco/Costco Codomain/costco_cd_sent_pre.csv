نيويورك - 9 أكتوبر 2025
شهدت أسهم شركة كوستكو هولسيل (Costco Wholesale Corp.) ارتفاعًا ملحوظًا اليوم، مدعومة بأداء مبيعات قوي في شهر سبتمبر تفوق التوقعات. أعلنت الشركة عن زيادة في المبيعات الإجمالية بنسبة 8% على أساس سنوي، ليصل إجمالي المبيعات إلى 26.58 مليار دولار. وفقًا للبيانات، ارتفعت المبيعات المقارنة بنسبة 5.7%، متجاوزة التوقعات التي كانت تبلغ 4.6%، مع نمو في الولايات المتحدة بنسبة 5.1%، وكندا 6.3%، والمناطق الدولية الأخرى 8.5%. ساهم الطلب الرقمي القوي في دفع هذا النمو، مما يعكس استمرارية الشركة في جذب المستهلكين رغم التحديات الاقتصادية. ردًا على هذه الأرقام الإيجابية، قفزت أسهم كوستكو في التداولات الصباحية، مما يعزز من ثقتها لدى المستثمرين.

These outstanding American citizens deserve better especially after what was done to their Queen so long ago...

Don't forget Honolulu has the only Royal Palace for a King & Queen on ""American"" soil.

the criminal gangs that steal vehicles and catalytic converters

I’m told they can have the catalytic converter off the car in something like three minutes
Although they often pick parking lot like CostCo where they know people will be in line for a long time
Since there’s no security at the Disneyland parking lot, I wonder how many people lose their catalytic converter there

Before Covid there was a vehicle stolen every six minutes in California, during Covid that rate increased to a vehicle stolen every 3 minutes

The FIB
Says that 80% of those vehicles end up south of the border

We could screen vehicles heading south of the border to control the theft of vehicles and the often violent carjacking that results in the deaths of adults and children

BUT GAVIN NEWSOM WOULD NEVER BOTHER DOING THAT

IT IS PART OF THE REASON OUR VEHICLE INSURANCE INCREASED OVER 50% IN THE PAST YEAR AND WILL PROBABLY GO UP AGAIN

Not only did Gavin destroy my small business with his draconian and erratic Covid lockdowns

But the increase in vehicle and home insurance, and our homeowners dues
the increase of other costs in California have added almost $250 a month to my basic cost of living,

On a 2.3% Social Security increase

I’m learning to hate these people
Arrogant liberal politicians

Also halal certification are starting to show up on products here in the USA as well as restaurants. Some companies like nestles’ and DuPont also carry these Halal certifications.  The problem lies in the ritual that is performed before slaughter or making a product halal. Before the cut, the slaughterer must recite “Bismillah Allahu Akbar” (In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest) to dedicate the act to God. This invocation is essential for the meat to be considered halal. So my question is whether this is meat offered to an idol or not?

Et leur modèle économique est tellement simple que ça en devient génial.

Ils vendent tout presque sans marge. Les produits sont vendus avec 10-15% de markup maximum. Parfois moins. Walmart fait 25%, Target 30%. Costco refuse de monter au-dessus de 15%.

Alors comment ils gagnent de l'argent ?

Les frais d'adhésion. $65 par an pour être membre. Ils ont 130 millions de membres dans le monde. Fais le calcul : $8.5 milliards de revenus purs. Sans vendre un seul produit.

Et voici le truc brillant : ce revenu arrive avant même que tu achètes quoi que ce soit. C'est du cash garanti, prévisible, récurrent. Les investisseurs adorent la prévisibilité.

Le taux de renouvellement est à 93%. Une fois que t'es membre, tu restes membre. Parce que les prix sont tellement bas que tu rentabilises ton abonnement en 2-3 visites.

Pendant que Amazon se bat sur la livraison rapide et les algorithmes complexes, Costco fait l'inverse. Des entrepôts géants, pas de décoration, des palettes au sol, et des prix imbattables.

Ils vendent seulement 4,000 produits. Amazon en a 350 millions. Mais Costco négocie des volumes massifs sur ces 4,000 références et obtient des prix que personne d'autre ne peut avoir.

Le business model n'a pas changé depuis 40 ans. Pas de disruption technologique. Pas de révolution digitale. Juste une exécution parfaite d'un concept ultra simple.

Pendant que tout le monde parle de tech, d'IA et d'innovation, Costco prouve qu'un modèle basique bien exécuté écrase la complexité.
