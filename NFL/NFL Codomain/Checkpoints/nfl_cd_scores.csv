I’ll own the three clear misses, but two pushes and two losses could’ve easily gone the other way but thats the nature of the game. One play can flip everything. A missed PAT, a blocked field goal (in the case of Rams we wouldve gladly taken a block but a freak play ensued).  A goal-line fumble (make that 2 for Pats and 5 total turnovers) or a safety for -2 pts Niners,  those moments change outcomes. 

I know, luck cuts both ways, and we’ll benefit from it too. Bottom line: we were a few breaks away from an 8–3 day. It happens.

Posted the article days ago so the writeup is old however we’ve been doing exceptionally well in NFL so far. Already labbing for Week 4 so be on the lookout. 60% hit rate = superstar capper. Might need to be NFL analyst in my bio too. Expect the domination to continue, last week Brown had 3 touchdowns. Lions are facing a Baltimore Ravens team on the road who currently have a line of +6.5. Jaire Alexander looks washed up & Marlon Humphrey is doubtful with a groin injury. Im ready for a classic Monday night shootout and expect to see St Brown in the end zone.

I was in my 30s, when I started realizing that I was conservative. Everything I believed in was conservative. I believed that welfare was a hand up and not a handout. I believed in lower taxes.

Over the course of an election cycle, I realized I had nothing in common with Democrats.

The smartest thing I ever did was accept who I was. 

I am embarrassed to say that I ever voted Democrat. The Democratic party from the last 10 years? They are an embarrassment. Men and girls sports? Males and female bathrooms?? And open border?

Easy to see why many are labeling this the best fight on the card. Doyer is a killer at range and in close, while Foro brings forward pressure and power. A matchup built for violence, meaning this number is built on WMMA bias. Usually I would agree lol but since we’re talking DWCS, I think we see fireworks from two women who have KO weapons and will be looking to show out. 10 of their 14 combined wins come by TKO.

Week 3: +0.39u 
2025: +7.70u

Hard to say what this DET offense will be under a new OC since both of their games have been blowouts. In those two, Gibbs had 10 targets for 10 catches in the first, and 3/3 in the second. That second game was a blowout win, so passing (somewhat) went out the game plan early. Since DET are dogs this week, I’m hoping we see Gibbs’ receiving stats somewhere in the middle with them expected to play behind at points. He’s locked in into their passing downs and BAL gave up 5 rec to James Cook and 6 to Jerome Ford in their two games. With a total as high as it is for tn, I think DET prioritizes getting Gibbs out in space.

🇧🇷Mahamed Aly vs. Iwo Baraniewski🇵🇱

Love getting plus money for two powerful LHWs finding a KO finish tn. We’re getting a solid price because Aly has world class BJJ and Baraniewski‘s last three fights have been ground and pound TKOs. However, we usually see two wrestler/grapplers cancel each other out in matchups like these and the DWCS setting could further assist this thought. Additionally, Aly has shown little to no interest in grappling since starting his MMA career, instead ending fights with his powerful strikes. With this fight lined to end u1.5, getting plus money on the KO feels like the way to go. 2u.

Not a fan of tonight’s game from a betting perspective so I’ll go value on a ATTD. Still hard to say what this Vikings O is made of, but I think we’re getting a nice price on Hock to score because of the struggles last week. He could still be the consistent second read in this offense with Addison suspended, playing 80% of the snaps week 1. With defenses expected to respect JJ, I’ll take a secondary target to score.

1966989921421349069,"👀Acceptance – The Trader’s Hidden Edge👀

🤔The Misunderstanding

Traders hear “acceptance” and think it means passivity, weakness, or giving up. In reality, it’s the opposite. Acceptance is a performance skill. It’s the ability to face the market exactly as it is and act accordingly.

❌Why Refusal Destroys Traders❌

Refusal shows up everywhere:

Refusing to accept a missed trade → chasing.
Refusing to accept a stop-out → revenge.
Refusing to accept a broken thesis → oversized losses.

🔴Each act of refusal is an emotional hedge against discomfort. But that hedge is expensive. It drains capital, energy, and trust in yourself.

🟢What Acceptance Really Does
Acceptance isn’t about liking losses or missed opportunities. It’s about contact with reality:

“This is happening.”
“I don’t need it to be different.”
“What’s my best move now?”

It gives you the clarity to cut when wrong, the patience to wait when flat, and the calm to re-enter when the edge reappears.

📉 Examples:
Price breaks your level and keeps running. Refusal says, “It has to come back.” Acceptance says: “I’m wrong. Flat. Next.”

You missed the morning move. Refusal says, “I’ll grab the next tick.” Acceptance says: “It’s gone. Protect capital. Prep for tomorrow.”

You take a loss. Refusal says, “I’ll get it back.” Acceptance says: “Loss logged. Day preserved. Still in business.”

🧠Why It Matters
In trading, process is survival. Acceptance keeps you tethered to process. It stops you from making price about you and keeps it about the plan. That difference is the line between a bad day and a blown account.

🔑The Takeaway

Every trader should ask: “What reality am I refusing right now?” Because the refusal you can’t see is usually the next mistake you’ll make.

☑️Acceptance doesn’t make trading easy. But it makes it possible.",negative,-0.57887316

Markets don’t just test your strategy—they hijack your nervous system.

Here’s the real cost of threat exposure:
• Fear → tilt + impulsive exits
• Anxiety → negative thought loops
• Hypervigilance → burnout + poor sleep
• Losses → self-esteem hits that bleed into relationships & health

That’s why most traders know to cut risk but don’t. Their biology + psychology are working against them.
The edge isn’t avoiding threat—it’s de-threating it.
👉 Mindfulness brings you back to the present.
👉 Values keep you consistent when PnL tempts you.
👉 Emotional awareness + defusion stop thoughts from dictating actions.

1960147645466624158,"🧠 What if sonder—the awareness that every human carries a rich, unseen world—could be your greatest trading edge?

Here’s how embracing that poetic insight transforms trading:

1⃣ Every impulse, every hesitation, every tilt is not discipline—or lack thereof—it’s history speaking. Behind every fear-driven trade or breakout chase lie stories, patterns, and survival habits that go far deeper than profit and loss. 

2⃣ Trading psychology isn’t about “fixing” people—it’s about honoring their stories. When you meet yourself with curiosity instead of judgment, you stop asking, “What’s wrong with me?” and start asking, “What’s happening beneath the surface?” 

3⃣ This shift isn’t soft—it’s strategic. Because once you map your emotional triggers, you can design performance tools that stick—and align decisions with your deeper values, not reactive habits. 

Here’s how to put sonder into action today:

• Name the Pattern. After a trade misstep, pause and ask: “Have I felt this before—outside the market? Where did that show up in my life?” 

• Pause & Breathe. One deep breath before reacting—because the present moment, not past losses or future fear, is where clarity lives. 

• Track Emotional Triggers. Create a “map” of your FOMO, revenge trade, or performance anxiety triggers and link them to their emotional roots. Awareness sparks agency. 

• Separate Behavior from Identity. Say “I acted impulsively,” not “I am impulsive.” That shift flattens shame and opens space for change. (

• Journal Your Origin Story. Get curious about how your past shaped your relationship with risk and money. Those patterns are powerful. 

• Values First. Before any major move, ask: “Does this align with the trader—and human—I want to be?” 

• Daily Reset Ritual. Begin your sessions with mindful breathing or gratitude. Ground your hours in clarity, not noise. 

• Reframe Self-Talk. Replace “What’s wrong with me?” with “What is this teaching me?”
 
• Create a Post-Loss Ritual. Whether it’s walking, writing, or stepping away—build recovery strategies that restore, not punish.'

• Talk It Out. Share what you notice with a peer or coach. Conversation reinforces that sonder—you’re not alone.  

Bottom line? Trading isn’t just a skill—it’s deeply personal. When you shift from self-judgment to self-leadership, you turn complexity into clarity, and pressure into purpose. That’s the difference between trading harder—and trading smarter, more humanely.

Pivetta should be game 1 starter but first playoff game isn’t until next Tuesday

Mon - Pivetta
Tue - Vásquez
Wed - Cease
Thu - off day
Fri - both Yu and King are eligible here so whoever pitches here is lined up for game 2 of playoffs. Maybe both pitch and piggy back off each other?
Sat - Pivetta 1-2 innings then whoever doesn’t pitch between Yu and King, or can call up Waldron or Cortes off IL, or bullpen game 
Sun - Vásquez 120 pitches time

If Waldron/Cortes does indeed get the call then there’s another debate on who else gets sent down because that person wouldn’t be eligible for playoffs. On top of David Morgan being eligible to return soon. Fringe relievers with options are Marinaccio, Bradgley, Hart.

The Best Prop For Monday Night Football 👀

🐦‍⬛ Zay Flowers OVER 69.5 Receiving Yards

Zay going into his 3rd year of his career this season is definitely looking like a breakout year for him and especially with this matchup he gets tonight on primetime football I just have to bet my coin on him, here’s why.

He’s started off the year on a very strong note going for 75 yards vs the Browns last week and going for 143 yards vs the Bills in week 1. He’s also seeing a 39.6% target share so far this season which is the 2nd highest behind JSN.

The last time he played Detroit which was back in 2023 he put up 75 yards on 6 targets, playing 72% of the snaps.

They’ve played man coverage at the 5th highest rate in the league so far this season. This is where Zay absolutely strives due to his speed and route running.

Detroit ranks 28th in receiving yards allowed, 18th in receptions allowed, 28th in longest reception allowed, and 17th in targets allowed to opposing WR’s.

Just last week they let Rome Odunze put up 128 yards on them and then in week 1 they let Romeo Doubs put up 68 yards vs them.

This game has the highest total of this week sitting at 53.5 points this means it should be an absolute shootout which should lead to more opportunities for Zay to get the ball. In that game vs the Bills in week 1 where Zay put up 143 yards, the game total was set at 51.5 points.

Not going to overthink this bet, Zay has an amazing matchup tonight along with a really good game script which could lead to guys like him having a big night.

Who’s Awake? Gibbs Goes Off Tomorrow! 

Cooked w/ @ShammyPlayz 🤝

🦁 Jahnyr Gibbs OVER 24.5 Receiving Yards

This is an absolute lock for tomorrow nights game. Gibbs is a huge contributor for this Lions offense not only running the ball but through the air. 

He has a 20% target share for the Lions and they have multiple schemes which make sure that this guy gets the ball quickly and makes plays with his legs.

In tomorrow’s matchup he gets a defense that has truly struggled against the RB position with receiving yds. The Ravens rank 32nd against opposing RB through the air. A top 3 RB in the league like Gibbs getting a line below 30 rec yds is simply disrespectful. 

We saw James Cook go for 50+ in week 1 in a high scoring fast paced game and I’m expecting this game to have a similar outcome. A total set at 53.5, tells me the books expect there to be a lot of offense in this game too. 

10 receptions in Week 1 and 3 in Week 2. Current line set at 3.5 if we can get 3+ catches out of Gibbs tomorrow there’s no doubt in my mind this is a cash.

Backing Sonic in a huge MNF Game.

My First Kicker Prop Of The 2025 Season!

⚡️Cameron Dicker OVER 1.5 FG Made

This is my first ever FG kicker prop of the 2025 season and it has to be Dicker the kicker with just how good he is at his position plus the matchup he gets this week vs the Denver Broncos.

Dicker just recently surpassed Justin Tucker for the career FG % record. He’s now the most accurate kicker the NFL has ever seen and holds the record for having the highest FG % in NFL history at 94%. So I’m not worried about him missing at all if he gets the FG attempts.

He’s over this line in his last 6 STRAIGHT games and went over in 72% of games last season averaging 2.3 FG made per game. Plus he’s started off this season well going over in both games with 2 FG made in each game along with a 100% FG % in both games.

Historically vs the Broncos Dicker has done pretty well as he’s over in his last 4/5 games vs them, and 3 STRAIGHT games. He went over in both games last season putting up 2 and 3 FG. 

Like I said if he sees the attempts I’m not worried about him missing at all especially since he holds the record for the highest FG % in NFL history. With 2+ FG attempts he’s over this line in his last 13 STRAIGHT games and over in his last 19/20 (95%) games averaging 2.8 FG per game.

The Broncos are a great matchup for Dicker in this game as so far this season they rank 2nd in red zone defense and have the 2nd lowest opponent red zone scoring percentage in the league at 25%. Last season they ranked 1st in red zone defense along with having the lowest opponent red zone scoring percentage in the league at 44.4%.

In week 1 vs the Tennessee Titans, Joey Syle made 4 FG on 4 attempts and in week 2 vs the Indianapolis Colts, Spencer Shrader made 5 FG on 5 attempts. The Chargers have a way better offense than both of these teams and Dicker is also a way better kicker than both these guys so he should see the same amount of opportunities as they did if not maybe even more.

Push His Tush Once Again! 🍑

🦅 Jalen Hurts OVER 0.5 Rush+Rec TDs

This prop is over -150 odds on every single book out there but is still a regular line prop on PrizePicks. Not sure why they keep giving us these odds on there but we have to run back Hurts for a TD this Sunday vs the Rams and here’s why.

Hurts has started off this season on a very good note with his team being 2-0 and him hitting this prop in both games so far this season. He put up 2 TD’s vs Dallas in week 1 and 1 TD vs the Chiefs last week.

One thing to mention is that in both of these games he’s used his legs pretty well as he’s rushed for 9 & 14 attempts. With 8+ rushing attempts he’s scored a TD in his last 13/14 games.

He played way better at Home compared to on the Road last season too as he scored a TD in 73% of Home games vs scoring a TD in 63% of Road games. Along with this he averaged 10.9 rushing attempts at Home vs averaging 8 rushing attempts on the Road.

Hurts has scored a TD in his last 2/3 games vs the Rams along with an average of 11.3 rushing attempts per game and an average of 3.7 rushing attempts.

Now we all know how over powered the tush push is and if the Eagles get to the 1 yard line it’s an automatic TD for Hurts every time. With 2+ red zone rushing attempts he’s scored a TD in his last 11/12 games and scored in 79% of games last season.

The Eagles are favorites to win this game at -190 odds along with a 3.5 spread. In games where they win, Hurts has scored a TD in his last 13/15 games and scored in 69% of games last season.

The Sneakiest Prop For NFL Sunday! 🤫

🔒 Nico Collins OVER 23.5 Longest Reception

Look even though Collins has had a very slow start to this season I still think he’s easily a top 10 receiver plus one of the best deep ball threats in the league. He now gets a matchup vs the Jaguars who we targeted last week with Ja’Marr Chase too.

The Texans currently are very limited on offensive weapons right now as both Christian Kirk and Braxton Berrios are questionable with a hamstring injury, Joe Mixon ruled out with a leg injury, Tank Dell ruled out with an ACL + MCL surgery and Stephon Diggs traded in the offseason. This leaves just two people, Dalton Shultz and Nico Collins.

The Jaguars have been absolutely horrible at stopping receivers so far this season. In week 1 vs the Panthers, Tetairoa McMillan went for 68 yards with his longest reception being for 21 yards. In week 2 vs the Bengals, Ja’Marr Chase went for 165 yards with his longest reception being for 25 yards and even Tee Higgins caught a pass for 42 yards in that game. Keep in mind Joe Burrow also ended up getting injured in the 1st half and didn’t return.

Nico was an absolute wagon last season when it came to his longest reception line. With a 20+ snap % he went over this line in 11/12 games last season averaging a 33.8 yards longest reception. 

He’s currently -470 odds to put up 40+ yards on Sunday. With 40+ receiving yards, he’s gone over this line in his last 16 STRAIGHT games averaging a 38+ yards longest reception per game.

In week 1 he missed this line vs the Rams with his longest reception being for just 14 yards. This was due to the Texans offense and O line looking absolutely atrocious along with CJ Stroud throwing for just 188 yards.

He’s coming off a game from last week vs the Buccaneers where on his first catch of the game he went over this line by catching a 29 yard TD on the first drive for the Texans.

Collins has gone over this line in his last 4/5 games vs the Jaguars with his one miss being at 23 yards, and in his last 4 STRAIGHT games vs them averaging a 29.8 yards longest reception per game. This includes both games vs them last season where he had a 40 yard and 26 yard longest reception in both games.

Jaguars defense ranking’s vs opposing WR’s ⬇️

25th in receptions allowed

Bijan Goes NUCLEAR on Sunday! ☢️

Cooked w/ @PropKitchen 👨‍🍳

🔒 Bijan Robinson OVER 80+ Rushing Yards

After the way that CJ Stroud and the Texans absolutely hoed us last time we had to run back another collab to get our revenge. This time we’re betting one of the best RB’s in the league Bijan Robinson vs a team with one of if not the worst run defenses in the league the Carolina Panthers.

Bijan solidified himself as a top 3 RB in the league throughout last season but seriously made that statement in the last 6 games of the season as he went over this line in all of those games averaging 112.2 rushing yards per game along with an average of 22.8 carries per game.

Last week when the Panthers played the Cardinals, James Conner only put up 34 yards on 11 carries due to him just playing horrible overall but in week 1 vs the Jaguars they allowed Travis Etienne to put up a crazy 143 yards on 16 carries vs them in a game where they lost 26-10.

Bijan started off this season on a very poor start rushing wise as in game 1 he put up just 24 rushing yards on 12 carries but was playing vs a very good Tampa Bay run defense and this game was a back and forth battle so the Falcons didn’t have much of a run heavy script in this one. He did have a major bounce back game in week 2 though vs the Vikings where he put up 143 rushing yards on 22 carries.

Now he gets to play vs an absolutely horrible Carolina Panthers defense who rank 32nd in rushing yards allowed and 32nd in rushing attempts allowed to opposing RB’s. In their last 10 games, 71% of opposing RB’s have gone over their respective rushing yards lines vs them with an average of 24.7 yards above their respective lines.

Notable RB’s vs the Panthers in their L10 games ⬇️

- Travis Etienne: 143 rushing yards
- Bucky Irving: 113 & 152 rushing yards
- James Conner: 117 rushing yards
- Rico Dowdle: 149 rushing yards
- Saquon Barkley: 124 rushing yards
- Tyrone Tracy: 103 rushing yards

He’s went over in both games vs Carolina last season putting up 170 yards on 28 carries and 95 yards on 15 carries. With 14+ carries he’s over in his last 11 STRAIGHT games averaging 112.1 rushing yards per game.

The Falcons are -250 odds and 5.5 points favorites to win this game. I honestly think that the Falcons should be leading majority of the game by a lot which should also mean they mainly have a run heavy script throughout this game. Bijan is over in his last 4 STRAIGHT wins averaging 112 rushing yards per game. 

Just another amazing matchup for a guy who we bet on to strive and clear his respective line with ease. Hopefully this time Bijan can respect coin unlike Stroud and come through for us.

Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as The Lord forgave you.

1969813979963826248,"To me the saddest part about these two losses is mainly just the visible lack of effort, heart, & intensity from the players on the defensive side of the ball.

The Offense definitely is not without fault & undoubtedly has to play better, but, even when they mess up I can still usually see a collective drive, hunger, & togetherness. I don’t see that from the Defense, & I genuinely believe if they were playing with a “leave it all on the field” mentality we’d be 4-0 right now.

As I’ve said many times before: I can live with getting beat because the other team was better, but, I can’t live with getting beat due to a lack of effort. I’m surprised to see this from a T-Will defense because I’ve felt in the past he’s done a good job of getting the most out of his players. There’s no way they’re not seeing & addressing this stuff when they watch it together after the games & yet we still didn’t see an ounce of improvement from last week. 

I’ll also say, if their on-field lack of care is any indication, then it makes perfect sense why they look so consistently lost & out of place even after the coaches chose to simplify what they were doing; because I would highly doubt at this point many of them are taking much time to hold themselves accountable & study film/mentally prepare outside of practice. Maybe a good start would be to bench some guys & get some players on the field that are going to play with a real sense of purpose & passion 

It’ll be harder now after 2 demoralizing losses, but, this team desperately needs a 🔥 lit inside of them; individually & collectively. I can only pray they receive it

I’m not going to excuse or dismiss what was definitely an awful performance but their biggest issues were more mental; being out of position, missed assignments, confusion, bad pursuit angles, & a sheer lack of effort; than they were them just not physically having the talent to play better. 

With the coaches taking a more simplified defensive approach this week; as they did in the 2nd Half last weekend when they surrendered just 10 points as opposed to the 31 they surrendered in 1st; we should look more fundamentally sound & our players shouldn’t be so consistently out of position, hesitant, & confused. While I certainly don’t think we’re going to suddenly become a great defense by merely simplifying things, I do however know they can show vast improvement by getting everyone on the same page, playing faster/harder, & eliminating those mental lapses. 

I expect that unit to show up & have a much stronger performance this Saturday @ Memphis; albeit against a substantially less explosive offense.

Had Arkansas won last week I might feel differently, but, given that they didn’t: they can’t afford to be overlooking any game; let alone a Road game against a Memphis team that every non-casual knows is a really good Group of 5 program. As focused & dialed in as the Hogs SHOULD be, I don’t really see this as a “trap game” at all. It’s a game where they’re without ANY excuse not to be motivated & prepared.

1968010715261722875,"This ""Fed is cutting into 🚀 asset and commodity prices"" is very popular and logically make sense as a concern

Historically, Energy has risen ~15% in the 6 months leading into a cutting cycle and broader commodities have risen ~3.4% on average over the same period ✅

At the inflection of the tightening/restrictive change to easing, precious metals begin to pick up steam while other commodities settle down ✅

The following 3-6-9 months later, previous metals (+9-12%) and energy (+6%) tend to perform rather well while other commodities have mixed-to-negative trends 🚀

Notably, broader commodities tend to respond with about a 3-5 month lag with about +3.5% 🚀 for every 100 bps drop in real rates (2y)

The monetary impact buoys gold, etc., while the economic concerns and investment allocation tradeoffs soften cyclical commodities, broader equities, etc.

Moreover, markets tend to front-run obvious policy transitions which is why the performance tends to be better heading INTO the cutting cycle... after all, Fed Funds basically follows the 2y with a 26 week lag.

As always, the go-forward performance is the fight between the denominator (USD) and the numerator (Economy)

I am my biggest fan. I validate myself on the good days, and I treat myself with the same kindness on the bad ones. I’ve accepted all sides of me good, bad, ugly and I am okay with it.
By practicing this every single day, the world is a better place for me ..  Because here’s the truth: we don’t derive joy from someone else it comes from within us..

Jesus is, was and will always be Jewish proof of that is during the millennial reign of Jesus Christ on the Earth feasts of the Lord will be honored and adhered to. Jesus Christ is the only way to the father he is God. The Jewish people have been temporarily blinded to allow Gentiles into the blessings of God. During the last days it is prophesied that the whole world will turn against Jews and it will be specifically because Jesus Christ came genetically through Jewish people. It is an attack of spiritual nature by Satan on the people that birthed the savior of the world.  During the great tribulation 144,000 Saints will come to belief in Jesus Christ and they will be Jewish young men that are virgins they will go across the whole world and bring millions to Faith. The Jewish people will come to Jesus Christ in faith in the last days during the tribulation period. The animosity of being shown by Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and many others towards Israel is a demonic hatred for Jesus, the Messiah there are good and bad people in every nation and every faith.  There’s a specific plan of salvation for the Gentiles meaning those that are not Jewish to enter into the blessing.  Without the Jewish people being temporarily blinded, no gentile at all would have entered into the salvation of Jesus Christ.  His death on the cross and his resurrection and him coming in the flesh is our only hope to entering the presence of God because he washes away through his blood sacrifice our sins.  Turned to Jesus now and do not be misled by those that are pushing a replacement theology. It is not the correct way.  You can love Jesus you can love the United States of America and you can love Israel at the same time. You should be loving everyone, even if they don’t share your own faith because they are lost and on their way to eternal separation from God, if they do not come to faith in Jesus Christ because he is the way the truth in the life no one comes onto the father, except through Jesus.",negative,-0.69480765
1968089159136149642,"Four fifth-grade girls, aged 10 and 11, were arrested in Surprise, Arizona, in October 2024 for allegedly plotting to murder a male classmate by luring him into a school bathroom, stabbing him in the stomach, and staging the scene to look like a suicide with a forged note. The motive stemmed from a ""relationship"" between one of the girls and the boy, where he had reportedly cheated on her, leading her to express hatred and a desire for him to die. The plot was discussed during lunch on October 1, 2024, and was overheard by another student, whose parent alerted the school that day. Police investigated, and the girls were arrested on charges of threatening and disorderly conduct, then released to their parents and suspended from Legacy Traditional School pending expulsion. Three of the girls and their families expressed remorse, while one did not appear fazed. Details of the incident were publicly released in police reports in June 2025
